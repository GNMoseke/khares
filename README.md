This is a fun toy project for a personal home dashboard meant to both be useful and as some Rust practice. Planned features:
1. Backlog tracking for games/movies/tv shows/books and a "now playing/reading/etc" (fancy spreadsheet)
2. Automatic planning of run/cycling routes based on a training schedule each morning
3. Getting the Nasa Astronomy Pictre of the Day/current xckd/wikipedia home page/etc or any other fun stuff
4. Plugin system for any other pieces that someone may want to use!
